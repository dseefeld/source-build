# Matrix build types:
#   Production: Only runs the build, not a tarball build. Called "production" because it's the part
#     used to produce tarballs. Some platforms might not be capable of producing a tarball yet: we
#     still call this type of build "production" for consistency.
#   Online: The leg produces a tarball then builds it while connected to the internet.
#   Offline: The leg produces a tarball then builds it offline. Network disconnected using Docker.
